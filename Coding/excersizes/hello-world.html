    <blockquote>
    Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. <br>
    <br>
    Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. <br>
    <br>
    We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. <br>
    <br>
    Shut up back there! And what's wrong with him, huh? <br>
    <br>
    Watch your tongue. You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King. <br>
    <br>
    Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us? <br>
    <br>
    I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits. No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening. <br>
    <br>
    Hey, what village are you from, horse thief? <br><br> Why do you care? <br><br> A Nord's last thoughts should be of home. <br>
    <br>
    Rorikstead. I'm... I'm from Rorikstead.<br>
    <br>
        ...looks like the Thalmor are with him.<br>
        <br>
    General Tullius, sir. The headsman is waiting. <br>
    <br>
    Good. Let's get this over with! Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me. <br>
    <br>
    Look at him. General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. <br>
    <br>
    Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this.<br>
    <br>
    Why are we stopping? <br>
    <br>
    Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods waiting for us.<br>
