    <b>Hey</b>, you. You're finally awake. <em>You were trying to cross the border, right?</em> Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. <br>

    <i><strong>Damn you Stormcloaks.</strong></i> <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=skyrim&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=1&lq=0&pq=skyr&sc=6-4&sk=&cvid=20F95A8A141544E78C07FDC0D59C4B9C&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=">Skyrim</a> was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, 
    I could've stolen that horse and be halfway to  <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Hammerfell">Hammerfell</a>. You there. You and me - <em>we shouldn't be here</em>. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants. <br>

        It's dangerous to go alone, steal this.
